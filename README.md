This report documents the design, implementation, and execution of a complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Python-based Student Course Enrollment web application. The primary objective was to automate the entire software delivery lifecycle, from code commit to production deployment and monitoring. The project successfully integrated a modern DevOps toolchain including Git, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, and the Grafana/Graphite monitoring stack. The final result is a robust, automated system that builds, tests, packages, deploys, and monitors the application, significantly improving development velocity, reliability, and operational visibility.
